 * @param useCase - Use case description from dossier
 * @returns JSON with prohibited status, rationale, and confidence per category
 */

TASK: Analyze the use case description to determine if it involves prohibited controversial weapons.

INPUT:
- Use case description: {useCase}

PROHIBITED CATEGORIES (per Axelera AI ESG and Responsible Use Policy):
1. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons
2. Cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines
3. Autonomous weapon systems (EU definition: weapon systems without meaningful human control over the critical functions of selecting and attacking individual targets)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Check each prohibited category carefully against the use case description
2. Look for direct involvement (design, production, distribution) AND indirect enabling (critical components for prohibited weapons)
3. For autonomous weapons: Assess if system lacks "meaningful human control" over target selection/attack
4. Consider dual-use potential (could technology be easily adapted for prohibited use?)

export const END_USE_RISK_PROMPT = `ROLE: You are an expert in autonomous weapons systems, dual-use technology assessment, and military AI applications, with deep knowledge of international humanitarian law.

TASK: Classify end-use risk based on three dimensions: human control, proximity to harm, and ease of repurposing, per HRDD Guide Annex 3.

INPUT:
- Use case description: {useCase}
- Search results with findings: {searchResults}

RISK CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA (HRDD Guide Annex 3):

LOW RISK (Green) - Limited Misuse Potential:
- Administrative, training, or logistical systems with minimal military impact
- Maintenance, diagnostics, or health/safety applications
- Defensive surveillance or access control that cannot directly enable attacks
- Misuse would result in operational inconvenience, not lethal effects

MEDIUM RISK (Orange) - Combat-Enabling Potential:
- Reconnaissance, intelligence, or battlefield awareness tools
- Target identification or tracking that still requires human decision-making
- Defensive electronic warfare or countermeasure systems
- Misuse could facilitate or accelerate combat operations

HIGH RISK (Red) - Near-Weaponization Potential:
- Semi-autonomous strike or targeting systems
- AI modules that could be adapted to launch attacks with limited human oversight
- Technologies that, in the wrong hands, could directly enable lethal or indiscriminate use
- Close to prohibited autonomous weapon functionality

THREE ASSESSMENT DIMENSIONS:

1. LEVEL OF HUMAN CONTROL:
   - High: Meaningful human control over all critical decisions (target selection, engagement)
   - Medium: Human oversight but system provides recommendations that could be auto-accepted
   - Low: Minimal human control, system operates autonomously with human monitoring only

2. PROXIMITY TO HARM:
   - Low: Administrative/logistical (personnel management, supply chain)
   - Medium: Combat-enabling (reconnaissance, target identification, battlefield awareness)
   - High: Near-weaponization (targeting assistance, strike coordination, autonomous navigation for weapons delivery)

3. EASE OF REPURPOSING:
   - Low: Difficult to repurpose (specialized hardware, limited flexibility)
   - Medium: Moderate repurposing risk (software-defined, but requires expertise)
   - High: Easy to repurpose (general-purpose AI, modular design, commercial-off-the-shelf)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze use case description for specific technical details about system functions
2. Assess level of human control - does human operator control target selection and engagement decisions?
3. Assess proximity to harm - how close is system to actual weapons delivery?
4. Assess repurposing ease - how easily could system be adapted for prohibited use?
5. Search for similar systems in defense media to understand typical applications
6. Compare to EU autonomous weapons definition (weapons without meaningful human control)
7. Check dual-use export control lists (Wassenaar, EU, US) for similar technologies
8. Review autonomous weapons frameworks (Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, ICRC guidance)
9. If technical documentation provided by Sales Team, review for autonomy indicators
10. Cite EVERY factual claim with [source_id]

}

EDGE CASES:
- Vague use case description: Request specific details in information_gaps, classify conservatively (Medium/High)
- Defensive-only system: Explain why proximity to harm is low despite military context
- Dual-use (civilian + military): Assess based on military application, note dual-use in rationale
- Technical documentation unavailable: Use publicly available info, note gap, reduce confidence
- Borderline human control (e.g., "human in the loop" but not "human on the loop"): Explain distinction with EU framework`;

## Overall Risk Classification

**Overall Risk Level: [Low / Medium / High]**

**Rationale:** The overall risk level is determined by the HIGHEST of the three risk factors:
- Geographic Context: [Low/Medium/High]
- Customer Profile: [Low/Medium/High]
- End-Use Application: [Low/Medium/High]

[Explain which factor(s) drove the overall classification and why]

## Recommended Conditions (if Medium/High Risk)

[If Low risk: "No additional conditions required beyond standard contract terms."]

[If Medium/High risk, list specific conditions, e.g.:]
- Contractual requirement to adhere to UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
- Regular monitoring and reporting (annual/semi-annual)
- Prohibition on resale or transfer without prior approval
- Technical safeguards (e.g., geofencing, usage logs)
- [Additional conditions based on specific risks identified]

## Information Gaps and Recommended Additional Research

[List all information gaps identified during assessment:]
- [Gap 1: e.g., "Freedom House 2024 score not yet published - used 2023 score"]
- [Gap 2: e.g., "Customer website has no published ethics policy - recommend direct inquiry"]
- [Gap 3: e.g., "Technical documentation not provided by Sales Team - recommend requesting system architecture diagram"]

[For each gap, recommend specific additional research or inquiries]
