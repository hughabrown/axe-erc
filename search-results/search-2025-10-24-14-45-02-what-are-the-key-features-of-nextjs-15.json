  "finalReport": "Next.js 15 introduces a range of features and improvements aimed at enhancing performance, developer experience, and compatibility with the latest technologies. Here are the key features:\n\n1. **@next/codemod CLI**: A new command-line tool that automates the upgrade process to the latest Next.js and React versions, simplifying code transformations and dependency updates [1], [6].\n\n2. **Async Request APIs**: Request-specific APIs like `headers`, `cookies`, `params`, and `searchParams` are now asynchronous, improving performance by allowing components to be pre-rendered without waiting for request-specific data [1], [2], [6].\n\n3. **Caching Semantics**: The default behavior for caching has changed. Fetch requests, GET Route Handlers, and client navigations are no longer cached by default, allowing developers to opt into caching as needed [1], [2], [6].\n\n4. **React 19 Support**: Full support for React 19, including new hooks like `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, and `useOptimistic`, as well as improvements in hydration error handling [1], [2], [9].\n\n5. **Turbopack**: Now stable, Turbopack offers significant performance improvements in local server startup and code updates, making it faster than Webpack in most scenarios [1], [2], [7].\n\n6. **Static Indicator**: A new visual indicator shows static routes during development, enhancing the developer experience [1], [2].\n\n7. **`unstable_after` API**: This experimental API allows developers to execute code after a response finishes streaming, providing more control over server-side logic [1], [6].\n\n8. **Enhanced Forms (`next/form`)**: Enhances HTML forms with client-side navigation capabilities, prefetching, and progressive enhancement [1], [2].\n\n9. **TypeScript Support for `next.config.ts`**: Developers can now use TypeScript for their Next.js configuration files, improving type safety and developer experience [1], [2].\n\n10. **Server Actions Security**: Improvements have been made to enhance the security of server actions, including unguessable endpoints and the removal of unused actions [1], [4].\n\n11. **Bundling External Packages**: New configuration options for optimizing the bundling of external packages in both App and Pages Router [1], [6].\n\n12. **ESLint 9 Support**: Next.js 15 adds support for ESLint 9, improving code quality checks [1], [2].\n\n13. **Partial Prerendering**: Allows Next.js to prerender the static shell of a page while streaming dynamic content separately, improving loading times and user experience [3], [9].\n\n14. **Improved Error Messages**: Enhancements to error messaging make it easier for developers to debug issues [4], [7].\n\n15. **Performance Improvements**: Various optimizations in build times, Fast Refresh capabilities, and data fetching processes enhance overall development efficiency [1], [8].\n\nThese features collectively aim to improve the stability, performance, and developer experience of Next.js applications, making Next.js 15 a significant update for developers [1], [2], [6].",
