## 1. Why do we have this policy?

Axelera AI B.V. ('Axelera' or the 'Company') is committed to conducting its business in a manner that brings together economic interests and corporate responsibility. As we develop AI hardware and software platforms for edge devices, we recognize our technology's potential impact on society and our responsibility to ensure its ethical use.

This ESG and Responsible Use Policy (the 'policy') demonstrates our commitment to international standards. We align our operations with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and commit to upholding the ten principles of the UN Global Compact covering human rights, labor standards, environment, and anti-corruption.

This policy establishes how we integrate environmental, social, and governance considerations throughout our operations, with particular focus on dual-use related applications and human rights protection. The policy ensures we:

- Prevent our technology from being used in ways that violate human rights or international law
- Maintain the highest standards of corporate responsibility
- Protect the long-term interests of the Company through sound governance
- Meet our commitments to investors regarding Responsible Use

Compliance is mandatory for all employees and business partners. Violations can result in:

- Reputational damage
- Legal liability under international human rights law
- Loss of confidence and breach of contractual obligations with investors
- Exclusion from certain markets and partnerships

## 2. Internal organization and responsibilities

### Governance Structure

The CEO is responsible for the Company's overall ESG strategy and performance, with oversight from the Board. The head of legal / compliance officer is responsible for implementing this policy and maintaining the operational procedures, including the Human Rights Due Diligence Assessment Guide, monitoring compliance, and reporting to the CEO on ESG matters.

### Ethics Review Committee

An Ethics Review Committee ('ERC') is established that assesses and advises the Board prior entering into dual-use engagements with customers.

The ERC operates according to the procedures detailed in the Human Rights Due Diligence Assessment Guide. The ERC regularly reports to the Board. Any medium and high-risk customer engagements will be brought to the Board for assessment and approval. For each case, the ERC prepares an assessment report containing risk classification with rationale, due diligence findings and recommended conditions. The Board decides on medium (Board Chair) and high-risk (Full Board) dual-use sales opportunities.

The ERC is composed of 3 members, appointed by the CEO. All members are employees and independent from the Sales department, 1 member being the head of legal/compliance officer. The ERC may be supported by an external advisor with expertise in business and human rights in the technology sector.

## 5. ESG Restricted Activities

### Dual-Use Applications

While Axelera technology may have legitimate dual-use applications, we maintain strict controls to ensure responsible use. All dual-use related opportunities undergo enhanced due diligence through the ERC, as set out in Section 5.

### Controversial Weapons

Axelera restricts the sale of its technology to any client or end-user that intends to use it for the development, production, or distribution of controversial weapons, including but not limited to nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, biological weapons, cluster munitions, anti-personnel mines, and autonomous weapon systems (EU definition: weapon systems without meaningful human control over the critical functions of selecting and attacking individual targets).

These restrictions cannot be waived by the Board.

### Other ESG Restricted Activities

Axelera furthermore does not engage in business activities that facilitate restricted activities as defined in Annex 1 - ESG Restricted Activities List.

## 6. Customer Screening and Human Rights Due Diligence

### Know Your Customer process

All customers undergo ESG screening as part of our Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Customers identified as having dual-use applications will be assessed through our Human Rights Due Diligence process.

### Human Rights Due Diligence Framework

To ensure robust identification and prevention of potential human rights violations, due diligence procedures have been established in order to screen potential dual-use sales opportunities, based on the following principles:

- Dual-use customers undergo human rights risk assessment
- Due diligence applies to both new and existing customers when material changes occur
- Customer compliance requires ongoing monitoring proportionate to risk
- Sales through third-party channels require equivalent due diligence standards and end-user visibility

### Risk Assessment and Categorization

Our human rights due diligence process identifies actual and potential adverse human rights impacts arising from the dual-use of our technology. Risk factors include:

- End-use application and weaponization potential
- Client profile and business activities
- Geographic deployment context

All dual-use sales opportunities undergo systematic risk assessment and are categorized as:

- **Low-risk:** Applications with minimal human rights concerns
- **Medium-risk:** Applications requiring enhanced due diligence, assessed by the Board
- **High-risk:** Applications with significant human rights implications requiring Board approval

### High-Risk Indicator

The following factor automatically triggers high-risk classification:

- Customers domiciled in or controlled from jurisdictions credibly accused by UN bodies, international courts, or recognized human rights organizations of serious and systematic violations of international humanitarian law, human rights law, or atrocity crimes

The ERC assesses all dual-use customer engagement, with medium and high-risk customer engagements for approval by the Board. The Human Rights Due Diligence Assessment Guide serves as our mandatory operational manual for implementing these principles.

## 7. Export Control and Sanctions Policy

This policy operates in conjunction with our Export Control and Sanctions Policy. All products undergo dual-use classification under Dutch and EU export control regulations, with customer screening procedures aligned across both policies to ensure comprehensive compliance.

## 8. Training and awareness

All employees receive training on ESG and responsible use principles during onboarding. Sales teams receive enhanced training on:

- Identifying high-risk applications of our technology
- Human rights risk factors
- Customer screening procedures
- ESG restrictions

Regular refresher training is mandatory for all employees, with additional sessions for teams in customer-facing roles.

## 9. Violations and corrective actions

### Reporting Concerns

Employees must immediately report to the compliance officer any:

- Potential human rights violations
- Breaches of ESG commitments and restrictions
- Customer misuse of technology
- False declarations by customers

Reports made in good faith are protected from retaliation.

### Investigation and Remediation

Upon suspected violation, we will conduct thorough investigation, implement corrective actions, and report to relevant stakeholders as required.

Corrective actions may include:

- Terminating problematic activities
- Enhanced procedures
- Additional training
- Customer relationship termination

### Disciplinary Measures

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment, depending on the severity and circumstances of the violation.

All violations are documented and tracked to ensure continuous improvement of our ESG practices.
