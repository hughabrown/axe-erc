## Firecrawl Strategy

### 1. Geographic Context Sites (Country-Specific Data)

**Strategy: Direct URL patterns + targeted extraction**

```javascript
// Example for Freedom House
const countryData = {
  freedomHouse: {
    urlPattern: "https://freedomhouse.org/country/{country_name}",
    fallbackSearch: "site:freedomhouse.org {country_name} freedom score",
    extractSchema: {
      freedomScore: "number",
      politicalRights: "number",
      civilLiberties: "number",
      status: "string" // Free, Partly Free, Not Free
    }
  },

  pressFreedom: {
    urlPattern: "https://rsf.org/en/country/{country_name}",
    fallbackSearch: "site:rsf.org {country_name} press freedom index",
    extractSchema: {
      ranking: "number",
      score: "number",
      trend: "string"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Customer Profile Sites (Company-Specific Data)

**Strategy: Search queries + structured extraction**

```javascript
// Sanctions screening approach
const sanctionsCheck = {
  ofac: {
    search: "site:sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov {company_name}",
    extract: {
      sanctioned: "boolean",
      programs: "array",
      aliases: "array"
    }
  },

  unGlobalCompact: {
    search: "site:unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants {company_name}",
    extract: {
      participant: "boolean",
      commitmentDate: "date",
      reportingStatus: "string"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. End-Use Application Sites (Technology/Weapons Data)

**Strategy: Keyword searches + document extraction**

```javascript
// Autonomous weapons research
const autonomousWeapons = {
  icrc: {
    search: "site:icrc.org autonomous weapons {application_description}",
    extract: {
      concerns: "array",
      legalPosition: "string",
      humanControlRequirement: "string"
    }
  },

  wassenaar: {
    search: "site:wassenaar.org AI technology dual-use",
    extract: {
      controlCategory: "string",
      licensingRequirement: "boolean"
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Known URL patterns**
- For sites with predictable URLs (Freedom House, RSF), try direct navigation first
- Use Firecrawl's `crawl` mode with specific URLs

**Phase 2: Fallback searches**
- If direct URLs fail, use `search` mode with site-specific queries
- Limit results to top 3-5 most relevant pages

**Phase 3: Extraction**
- Use Firecrawl's `extract` mode with predefined schemas
- Store raw HTML for audit trail

**Phase 4: Aggregation**
- Combine data from all sources
- Apply HRDD Guide scoring rules
- Generate risk assessment report
