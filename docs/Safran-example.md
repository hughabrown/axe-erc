Risk Factor 3: End-Use Application & Weaponization Potential
Assesses the impact potential if the application were misused or diverted to a bad actor, considering three dimensions: level of human control, proximity to harm, and ease of repurposing for harm.
Application Description: Military binoculars with AI-enabled people detection for reconnaissance and observation purposes. The system uses computer vision and deep learning for enhanced detection, tracking, and classification of persons in operational environments. Function is decision-support for human operators maintaining full control over targeting decisions.
Weaponization Assessment:
‚Ä¢	Level of Human Control:
‚Ä¢	HIGH: Human-in-the-loop architecture
‚Ä¢	AI provides information to support human decisions
‚Ä¢	Operators maintain full authority over all actions taken based on AI information
‚Ä¢	Multiple human decision points between detection and any potential use of force
‚Ä¢	Classification: Decision-support tool, NOT decision-maker
‚Ä¢	Evidence: Application technical description, industry standards for military observation systems
‚Ä¢	Proximity to Harm:
‚Ä¢	LOW-MEDIUM: Significantly removed from direct harm
‚Ä¢	Observation and reconnaissance function only
‚Ä¢	No direct force application capability
‚Ä¢	Requires human intermediaries for any engagement decisions
‚Ä¢	Binoculars cannot apply force
‚Ä¢	Position on 1-10 risk scale: 3-4 out of 10
o	1-2: Pure intelligence collection (satellites, passive sensors)
o	3-4: AI-ENABLED MILITARY BINOCULARS ‚Üê Current application
o	5-6: Target cueing systems (recommend targets for review)
o	7-8: Semi-autonomous weapons (human approval required)
o	9-10: Fully autonomous systems targeting humans
‚Ä¢	Ease of Repurposing:
‚Ä¢	MODERATE: Possible but requires significant changes
‚Ä¢	Technology is technically adaptable
‚Ä¢	Repurposing to autonomous weapons would require:
o	Significant integration connecting observation to weapons systems
o	Authorization changes and command approval for autonomous engagement
o	Doctrinal shifts from observation to targeting protocols
o	Overriding multiple safeguards and command structures
o	Legal reviews under Article 36 of Additional Protocol I
‚Ä¢	Current safeguards reducing repurposing risk:
‚Ä¢	Physical separation between observation and weapons platforms
‚Ä¢	Command protocol requirements for engagement authorization
‚Ä¢	Legal frameworks requiring human decisions on use of force
‚Ä¢	Operational doctrines maintaining human control
‚Ä¢	Article 36 weapons review requirements for new systems
‚Ä¢	Autonomous Weapons Compliance:
‚Ä¢	Complies with EU definition: ‚úÖ Yes - maintains meaningful human control
o	EU AI Act definition: "weapon systems without meaningful human control over critical functions of selecting and attacking individual targets"
o	Application does NOT select or attack targets autonomously
o	Observation tool providing information for human decision-makers
‚Ä¢	International Framework Compatibility:
o	ICRC Definition: "Systems that select and apply force to targets without human intervention"
ÔÇß	Link: https://www.icrc.org/en/law-and-policy/autonomous-weapons 
ÔÇß	Assessment: AI binoculars do NOT apply force to targets
o	US DoD Directive 3000.09: Requires "appropriate levels of human judgment" over use of force
ÔÇß	Assessment: Maintains human judgment requirement
o	Meaningful Human Control Framework: Requires predictability, contextual information, temporal/spatial limits, human intervention capability
ÔÇß	Assessment: Meets all requirements - humans control all force decisions
o	CCW Guiding Principles (2019): Humans must remain responsible for force decisions
ÔÇß	Link: https://meetings.unoda.org/ccw-/convention-on-certain-conventional-weapons
ÔÇß	Assessment: Complies - humans responsible for all targeting decisions
International Humanitarian Law Compatibility:
‚Ä¢	Distinction: ‚úÖ Compatible - AI enhances distinction capability by improving identification of combatants vs civilians, but humans verify classifications before engagement decisions
‚Ä¢	Proportionality: ‚úÖ Compatible - Cannot be automated; requires subjective balancing of military advantage vs expected civilian harm. AI provides information to support human proportionality assessments
‚Ä¢	Precautions: ‚úÖ Compatible - AI improves precautionary measures through better situational awareness and enhanced detection of civilians, supporting human precautionary obligations
Legal Scholar Concerns to Address:
‚Ä¢	Accountability gaps when AI makes misidentifications ‚Üí Requires human verification protocols
‚Ä¢	Automation bias where operators defer to AI without verification ‚Üí Requires comprehensive training
‚Ä¢	Black box opacity hindering review of decisions ‚Üí Requires explainability measures
‚Ä¢	Inability to automate subjective proportionality balancing ‚Üí Humans maintain this judgment
‚Ä¢	Critical need for human agency in IHL compliance ‚Üí Maintained through human-in-the-loop design
Assessment: AI military binoculars are COMPATIBLE with IHL if:
‚Ä¢	Used as decision-support tools with trained operators
‚Ä¢	Humans maintain meaningful control over targeting decisions
‚Ä¢	Systems not integrated into autonomous engagement chains
‚Ä¢	Operators verify AI classifications before any use of force
‚Ä¢	Adequate training provided on AI limitations and biases

‚Ä¢	Human rights assessment mandatory for military exports under Arms Trade Treaty obligations and EU Common Position 2008/944/CFSP
Comparative Military AI Applications:
‚Ä¢	Project Maven (US DoD): AI video analysis for ISR - similar observation/analysis function
‚Ä¢	Naval systems (PASEO XLR): AI detection enabling commanders to make engagement choices with human decision authority
‚Ä¢	Geospatial intelligence (http://Safran.AI ): 53M+ annotated objects for automatic military object detection, supporting analyst decisions
‚Ä¢	Industry standards: DoD AI Ethical Principles (responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, governable), NATO JISR standards, Article 36 weapons reviews, EU Defence Fund ethical screening
Key Mitigations Required:
‚Ä¢	Contractual prohibition on integration into autonomous targeting systems
‚Ä¢	Mandatory human-in-the-loop architecture requirements
‚Ä¢	Operator training on AI limitations, biases, and verification requirements
‚Ä¢	End-use restrictions preventing Yemen deployment
‚Ä¢	Technical safeguards against unauthorized repurposing
‚Ä¢	Regular monitoring and audit rights
Positive Factors:
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ No direct harm capability - binoculars cannot apply force
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Human-in-the-loop for all decisions - operators maintain full control
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Passive observation only - information gathering, not action execution
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Multiple decision points before engagement - observation ‚Üí assessment ‚Üí command authorization ‚Üí execution
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Reversible outputs - operators can disregard or verify AI detections
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Predictable function - well-established computer vision with defined parameters
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Established use case - military observation is longstanding legitimate function
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Compatible with IHL principles when properly used
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Positioned at low-risk end of autonomy spectrum (3-4 out of 10)
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ France and Safran endorse responsible military AI principles
Negative Factors:
‚Ä¢	Automation bias considerations - standard training on AI limitations mitigates
‚Ä¢	Potential misclassification - human verification protocols address
‚Ä¢	Dual-use nature - standard contractual restrictions appropriate
‚Ä¢	Training requirements - typical for military AI systems
‚Ä¢	AI explainability - standard for current detection systems
‚Ä¢	Decision timeline considerations - human control maintained
‚Ä¢	Safeguards against misuse - standard contractual provisions recommended
Classification: üü¢ LOW RISK (3-4 out of 10)
Rationale: Military binoculars with AI-enabled people detection represent observation and decision-support systems positioned at the low-risk end of the military AI spectrum (3-4 out of 10). They are fundamentally different from autonomous weapons systems of highest international concern (9-10) - those targeting humans without meaningful human control. The application maintains human-in-the-loop architecture, provides decision-support not decision-making, has no direct force application capability, and is compatible with international humanitarian law. As standard dual-use AI surveillance technology in military applications, appropriate contractual safeguards for end-use restrictions and monitoring represent industry best practice.

Rationale: France is an established democracy and NATO/EU ally with strong institutional safeguards. Safran is a well-governed, publicly traded defense contractor with transparent compliance systems. The application is a low-risk observation/decision-support tool maintaining meaningful human control. As standard dual-use AI technology for military applications, appropriate contractual safeguards for end-use restrictions and monitoring are recommended as best practice.
