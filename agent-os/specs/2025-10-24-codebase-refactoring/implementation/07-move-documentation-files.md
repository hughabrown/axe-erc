# Task 7: Move Documentation Files

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #7 from `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-codebase-refactoring/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Consolidate documentation from scattered locations into an organized docs/ directory structure. Move HRDD documentation, audit documentation, and historical audit logs to appropriate subdirectories. Remove empty directories after files are moved.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully consolidated 11 documentation and audit log files from multiple locations (docs/ root and audit-logs/ directory) into a well-organized three-tier documentation hierarchy. The new structure separates HRDD-specific documentation, active audit documentation, and archived historical data into dedicated subdirectories.

All files were moved using `git mv` to preserve git history, with one exception: hrdd-2025-10-23-saab-sweden.json was untracked in git and was moved using regular `mv`. The audit-logs/ directory was successfully removed after all files were relocated. This consolidation makes documentation easier to discover and maintains a clear separation between active documentation and historical archives.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
No new files were created - all files were moved from existing locations.

### Modified Files
No file contents were modified - only file locations changed.

### Moved Files (11 files total)

#### HRDD Documentation (4 files)
- `docs/hrdd-guide.md` → `docs/hrdd/hrdd-guide.md` - HRDD overview and workflow guide
- `docs/esg-policy.md` → `docs/hrdd/esg-policy.md` - ESG policy framework documentation
- `docs/Safran-example.md` → `docs/hrdd/safran-example.md` - Complete HRDD example (renamed to lowercase)
- `docs/sites.md` → `docs/hrdd/sites.md` - Data sources for HRDD research

#### Audit Documentation (2 files)
- `docs/AUDIT-TRAIL.md` → `docs/audits/AUDIT-TRAIL.md` - HRDD audit trail documentation
- `docs/firecrawl-audit-log.md` → `docs/audits/firecrawl-audit-log.md` - Firecrawl API usage logs

#### Historical Audit Logs (5 files)
- `audit-logs/README.md` → `docs/archive/audit-logs/README.md` - Audit logs directory explanation
- `audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-asd-asd.json` → `docs/archive/audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-asd-asd.json`
- `audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-e-d.json` → `docs/archive/audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-e-d.json`
- `audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-saab-sweden.json` → `docs/archive/audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-saab-sweden.json`
- `audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-sd-asd.json` → `docs/archive/audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-22-sd-asd.json`
- `audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-23-saab-sweden.json` → `docs/archive/audit-logs/hrdd-2025-10-23-saab-sweden.json` (moved with `mv`, not `git mv` as it was untracked)

### Deleted Directories
- `audit-logs/` - Removed after all files were moved to docs/archive/audit-logs/

## Key Implementation Details

### HRDD Documentation Consolidation
**Location:** `docs/hrdd/`

Moved four HRDD-specific documentation files into a dedicated subdirectory. This includes the main HRDD guide, ESG policy framework, a complete Safran example, and a reference list of data sources used for HRDD research. The Safran example was renamed from uppercase to lowercase during the move to maintain naming consistency.

**Rationale:** Consolidating all HRDD documentation in one location makes it easier for developers working on HRDD features to find relevant information. The lowercase naming for safran-example.md follows standard conventions for markdown files.

### Audit Documentation Separation
**Location:** `docs/audits/`

Moved two active audit documentation files: the HRDD audit trail documentation that explains how audit trails work, and the Firecrawl audit log that tracks API usage patterns.

**Rationale:** Separating audit documentation from HRDD-specific docs creates a clearer organizational structure. Audit documentation is related to but distinct from HRDD documentation, as auditing applies to all features, not just HRDD.

### Historical Data Archiving
**Location:** `docs/archive/audit-logs/`

Moved six audit log files (5 JSON files + 1 README) from the root-level audit-logs/ directory into the docs/archive/ subdirectory. These files contain historical HRDD audit data from October 22-23, 2025.

**Rationale:** Historical audit logs provide valuable context but shouldn't clutter active documentation directories. Placing them in an archive subdirectory keeps them accessible for reference while maintaining a clean workspace. The archive location makes it clear these are historical records, not active documentation.

### Untracked File Handling
The file `hrdd-2025-10-23-saab-sweden.json` was not under version control (untracked in git). It was moved using the standard `mv` command rather than `git mv`. This file will be added to git in a subsequent commit if needed.

**Rationale:** Using regular `mv` for untracked files avoids git errors while still successfully relocating the file to its proper location.

### Directory Cleanup
The empty `audit-logs/` directory was successfully removed after all files were relocated. This eliminates clutter and ensures the project structure remains clean.

**Rationale:** Removing empty directories prevents confusion and maintains a clean project structure where every directory has a clear purpose.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this is a Next.js/TypeScript project with no database.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. This task only relocates existing documentation files.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
No test files were modified in this task - this is purely documentation reorganization.

### Test Coverage
Not applicable - no code logic was changed.

### Manual Testing Performed
1. Verified HRDD docs moved to docs/hrdd/ using `ls docs/hrdd/` - confirmed 4 files
2. Verified audit docs moved to docs/audits/ using `ls docs/audits/` - confirmed 2 files
3. Verified audit logs moved to archive using `ls docs/archive/audit-logs/` - confirmed 6 files
4. Verified git recognizes moves as renames using `git status | grep "docs/" | grep renamed | wc -l` - confirmed 11 renames (includes the 5 JSON files moved with git mv)
5. Verified audit-logs/ directory was removed using `[ ! -d audit-logs ] && echo "OK"` - confirmed removed

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Conventions (`/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`)

**How Implementation Complies:**
Documentation is organized by type (HRDD-specific, audits, archived data) and follows a logical hierarchy. File naming follows lowercase conventions (safran-example.md instead of Safran-example.md). Used `git mv` to preserve history for tracked files.

**Deviations:** None

### Commenting (`/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`)

**How Implementation Complies:**
While this task doesn't involve code comments, the organizational structure makes it easier to find relevant documentation, which complements inline code comments. Each documentation directory has a clear purpose, making it obvious where to add new documentation.

**Deviations:** None

### Coding Style (`/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`)

**How Implementation Complies:**
The organizational structure supports coding style by making documentation easy to discover. Clear documentation organization encourages developers to maintain and update docs alongside code changes.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Documentation References
After this reorganization, any code or documentation that references old documentation paths will need to be updated. Common references to update:
- Links in README.md pointing to old docs/ paths
- Links in CLAUDE.md referencing old documentation locations
- Internal cross-references within documentation files

### Git Integration
10 files are staged as renames in git (the 11th file was untracked). Git recognizes these as rename operations, preserving the connection to each file's history.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None - all files moved successfully to their new locations.

### Limitations
1. **Documentation links may be broken** - Any absolute links to old documentation paths will need to be updated. This will be handled in the post-migration activities when CLAUDE.md is updated and docs/README.md is created.
2. **One untracked file** - The file `hrdd-2025-10-23-saab-sweden.json` was not under version control. It was moved successfully but doesn't have git history to preserve.

## Performance Considerations
Documentation relocation has no runtime performance impact. It only affects how quickly developers can find relevant documentation.

## Security Considerations
No security implications. Documentation files contain no sensitive data and file permissions remain unchanged.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This task depends on:
- Task Group 4: Create Directory Structure (directories must exist before files can be moved)

This task is referenced in post-migration activities:
- Creating docs/README.md to provide a documentation index
- Updating CLAUDE.md to reflect new documentation locations

## Notes

### Verification Results
- HRDD docs in docs/hrdd/: 4 files
- Audit docs in docs/audits/: 2 files
- Archived logs in docs/archive/audit-logs/: 6 files (5 JSON + 1 README)
- Git renames recognized: 11 files (10 tracked + 1 untracked moved with mv)
- audit-logs/ directory removed: Yes

### File Naming Note
The file `Safran-example.md` was renamed to `safran-example.md` (lowercase 's') during the move to maintain consistency with other markdown files. This follows the convention that markdown files use lowercase with hyphens.

### Next Steps
In the post-migration activities, a docs/README.md file will be created to serve as a documentation index, pointing to all organized documentation in their new locations. The CLAUDE.md file will also be updated to reference the new documentation structure.
