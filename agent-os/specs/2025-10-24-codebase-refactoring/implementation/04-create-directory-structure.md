# Task 4: Create Directory Structure

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #4 from `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/specs/2025-10-24-codebase-refactoring/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** âœ… Complete

### Task Description
Create all necessary directories for the new organizational structure before moving any files. This includes subdirectories for lib (core, synthesis, hrdd, export, utils), test files, documentation, and archived specs.

## Implementation Summary
Successfully created a hierarchical directory structure that groups related files by functional domain. The new structure separates core search engine functionality, synthesis logic, HRDD-specific code, utilities, and tests into dedicated subdirectories. This provides clear boundaries between different concerns and makes the codebase immediately navigable for new contributors.

All 12 directories were created using `mkdir -p` to ensure parent directories exist and to avoid errors. The directory creation followed a logical pattern: code organization directories first (lib subdirectories), then test directories mirroring the code structure, documentation subdirectories for different content types, and finally the archive for completed specifications.

## Key Implementation Details

### Lib Code Organization (5 directories)
**Location:** `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/lib/`

Created five subdirectories to organize business logic by functional domain:
- `core/` - Contains the main search engine, configuration, context processing, and Firecrawl client
- `synthesis/` - Houses multi-pass synthesis logic, content storage, and citation validation
- `hrdd/` - Dedicated space for all Human Rights Due Diligence workflow and analysis code
- `export/` - Utilities for exporting search results and audit trails
- `utils/` - Shared utilities like error handling, rate limiting, and favicon utilities

**Rationale:** Separating concerns into distinct directories improves discoverability and maintains clear boundaries between different features. The core search functionality is isolated from domain-specific features like HRDD, making it easier to maintain and extend each independently.

### Test Organization (3 directories)
**Location:** `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/lib/__tests__/`

Created test subdirectories that mirror the code structure:
- `core/` - Tests for configuration, content store, and content population
- `synthesis/` - Tests for all four synthesis passes, integration tests, and acceptance tests
- `hrdd/` - Tests for HRDD configuration, state, preliminary screening, risk factors, and synthesis

**Rationale:** Test files organized to mirror source code structure makes it intuitive to locate tests for any given module. This organization follows industry best practices and aligns with the Jest test runner's conventions.

### Documentation Structure (3 directories)
**Location:** `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/docs/`

Created a three-tier documentation hierarchy:
- `hrdd/` - HRDD-specific documentation (guide, ESG policy, examples, site references)
- `audits/` - Active audit documentation (audit trail and Firecrawl logs)
- `archive/audit-logs/` - Historical audit data separated from active documentation

**Rationale:** Separating documentation by type (HRDD-specific vs audits) and status (active vs archived) makes it easier to find relevant information and prevents documentation clutter.

### Spec Archive (1 directory)
**Location:** `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/archive/specs/`

Created archive location for completed specifications to separate them from active work.

**Rationale:** Completed specs provide valuable historical context but shouldn't clutter the active specs directory. Archiving maintains a clean workspace while preserving the full implementation history.

## Database Changes
Not applicable - this is a Next.js/TypeScript project with no database.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. This task only creates directories.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
Not applicable - no test files were created in this task.

### Test Coverage
Not applicable for directory creation.

### Manual Testing Performed
Verified all 12 directories were created successfully by running a validation loop that checked for the existence of each directory. All directories returned "OK" status.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Global Conventions (`/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`)

**How Implementation Complies:**
The directory structure follows clear naming conventions with lowercase directory names and hyphenated multi-word names (e.g., `audit-logs`, `__tests__`). The hierarchical organization groups related files together, which aligns with conventions for maintainable project structure.

**Deviations:** None

### Coding Style (`/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`)

**How Implementation Complies:**
While this task doesn't involve code, the directory structure supports clean code organization by providing logical groupings. The separation of concerns principle is applied at the directory level, making it easier to follow coding style guidelines within each module.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### Directory Usage
These directories will be populated by subsequent tasks:
- Task Group 5 will move core library files into the new lib subdirectories
- Task Group 6 will move test files into the new test subdirectories
- Task Group 7 will move documentation into the new docs subdirectories
- Task Group 8 will move completed specs into the archive

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None

### Limitations
None

## Performance Considerations
Directory creation is instantaneous and has no performance impact on the application.

## Security Considerations
No security implications. The directories are created with default file system permissions.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This task is a dependency for:
- Task Group 5: Move Core Library Files
- Task Group 6: Move Test Files (via Task Group 5)
- Task Group 7: Move Documentation Files
- Task Group 8: Archive Completed Specs

## Notes
All directories were created using `mkdir -p` which creates parent directories as needed and doesn't fail if directories already exist. This makes the operation idempotent and safe to re-run.

The directory structure was designed to be immediately understandable to new contributors. Each directory has a clear single purpose, and related files are logically grouped together. This aligns with the spec's goal of creating a "clean minimalist file system where every file has a clear purpose."
