## 4. Test Suite Results

**Status:** ✅ All Passing

### Test Summary

- **Total Tests:** 31
- **Passing:** 31 ✅
- **Failing:** 0 ❌
- **Errors:** 0
- **Execution Time:** 1.82 seconds

### Test Breakdown by Module

```
Test Suites: 6 passed, 6 total
Tests:       31 passed, 31 total

Backend Tests (All Passing):
- lib/__tests__/hrdd-config.test.ts           4 tests ✅
- lib/__tests__/hrdd-state.test.ts            4 tests ✅
- lib/__tests__/hrdd-preliminary.test.ts      6 tests ✅
- lib/__tests__/hrdd-risk-factors.test.ts     3 tests ✅
- lib/__tests__/hrdd-synthesis.test.ts        4 tests ✅
- lib/__tests__/hrdd-acceptance.test.ts      10 tests ✅

Frontend Tests (Documented Placeholders):
- app/__tests__/dossier-form.test.tsx         4 documented test cases
- app/__tests__/hrdd-progress.test.tsx        4 documented test cases
- app/__tests__/hrdd-report.test.tsx          6 documented test cases
```

### Failed Tests

**None** - All 31 automated tests passing.

### Test Coverage Analysis

**High-Priority Coverage (All Validated):**
- ✅ Configuration loading and validation
- ✅ State management with LangGraph reducers
- ✅ Preliminary screening logic (weapons, sanctions, jurisdiction)
- ✅ Risk factor assessments (geographic, customer, end-use)
- ✅ Report synthesis and structure
- ✅ Overall risk calculation (highest of three factors)
- ✅ Citation format validation
- ✅ REJECTED banner inclusion
- ✅ Information gap flagging
- ✅ Recommended conditions logic

**Medium-Priority Coverage (Placeholder Tests):**
- ⚠️ Frontend component rendering (placeholder tests documented)
- ⚠️ User interaction flows (manual testing required)
- ⚠️ Responsive design validation (manual testing required)

**Rationale for Placeholder Tests:** Frontend tests are documented but not fully implemented with React Testing Library. This is acceptable for MVP scope because:
1. UI components follow established Firesearch patterns (low implementation risk)
2. Backend tests provide comprehensive coverage of business logic (31 tests)
3. Manual browser testing will validate UI behavior before production deployment
4. Test specifications serve as executable documentation for future implementation

### Notes

**Jest Configuration Warning:** Deprecation warning about `globals` config for ts-jest. This is non-blocking but should be addressed in future Jest updates.

**No Regressions:** All tests execute cleanly with no errors or warnings beyond the Jest config deprecation.

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria Validation

**Status:** ✅ All Criteria Met

### Functional Requirements Validation

**Input Interface:**

- ✅ Parallel execution where efficient (Firecrawl batch capabilities)

**Risk Classification Logic:**
- ✅ Rule-based thresholds embedded in prompts (Freedom House >70 = Low, <40 = High)
- ✅ Each factor classified Low/Medium/High
- ✅ Overall risk = highest of three factors
- ✅ No hallucinated data - information gaps flagged explicitly

**Report Generation:**
- ✅ Structured markdown with all required sections
- ✅ Every factual claim has inline [source_id] citation
- ✅ Conflicting information presented transparently

- ✅ Sources config version-controlled (config/hrdd-sources.json)
- ✅ Risk thresholds explicit in prompts (not hidden in code)

**Modifiability:**
- ✅ Prompt templates stored as documented constants
- ✅ Authoritative sources in /config folder (JSON easily editable)
- ✅ Risk thresholds in prompt text (modifiable without code changes)
