### Check 2: Visual Assets
**Status:** N/A (No visual assets)

No visual files found in planning/visuals/ directory. This is appropriate for the HRDD feature, which adapts existing UI patterns without new visual mockups.

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking
**Status:** N/A (No visuals provided)

No visual mockups provided. Spec correctly notes this on line 97: "No mockups provided. Maintain existing Firesearch styling with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components."

### Check 5: Core Specification Issues
**Status:** PASSED

- **Goal alignment:** PASSED - Goal directly addresses transforming Firesearch into HRDD tool (line 3-6)
- **User stories:** PASSED - All 6 user stories trace to requirements (ERC member inputting dossier, automatic checks, authoritative sources, citations, information gaps, structured report)
- **Core requirements:** PASSED - All from user discussion, no additions beyond requirements
- **Out of scope:** PASSED - Matches what requirements state should not be included
- **Reusability notes:** PASSED - Spec section "Reusable Components" (lines 106-148) explicitly lists existing code to leverage

### Check 6: Task List Issues

**Test Writing Limits:**
STATUS: **PASSED** - Fully compliant with focused testing approach

- Task Group 1: Write 2-4 focused tests (Task 1.4) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 2: Write 8-20 focused tests distributed across 5 sub-tasks (Tasks 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7) - COMPLIANT
  - State: 2-4 tests
  - Preliminary: 2-6 tests
  - Risk factors: 2-6 tests
  - Synthesis: 2-4 tests
- Task Group 3: Write 2-4 focused tests (Task 3.1) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 4: Write 2-4 focused tests (Task 4.1) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 5: Write 2-4 focused tests (Task 5.1) - COMPLIANT
- Task Group 6: Maximum 10 additional end-to-end tests (Task 6.3) - COMPLIANT

**Total Test Count:** 18-36 tests from implementation + max 10 from testing-engineer = **28-46 tests maximum** - APPROPRIATE for feature scope

**Test Verification Approach:**
- Each task group runs ONLY newly written tests, not entire suite - COMPLIANT (tasks 1.5, 2.10, 3.4, 4.4, 5.7)
- Final task (6.4) runs all HRDD feature tests together - APPROPRIATE

**Reusability References:**
- Task 1.2 references existing /lib/config.ts pattern - GOOD
- Task 2.2 references existing SearchStateAnnotation pattern - GOOD
- Task 2.9 references existing langgraph-search-engine.ts - GOOD
- Task 3.2 notes to reuse Radix UI components - GOOD
- Task 4.2 notes to reuse existing animation patterns - GOOD
- Task 5.2-5.3 explicitly verify existing components work without modification - EXCELLENT

**Task Specificity:**
- All tasks reference specific features/components - PASSED
- Tasks include specific file paths for all implementations - PASSED
- Acceptance criteria clear and measurable - PASSED

**Visual References:**
- N/A (no visual assets provided)

**Task Count:**
- Configuration: 5 tasks (appropriate for foundation work)
- Workflow: 10 tasks (appropriate for complex LangGraph workflow)
- Dossier form: 4 tasks (appropriate for simple form)
- Progress display: 4 tasks (appropriate for UI adaptation)
- Report display: 7 tasks (appropriate for display + banners)
- Testing: 5 tasks (appropriate for validation)
- **Total: 35 tasks** across 6 task groups - APPROPRIATE, not over-engineered

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
**Status:** PASSED

**Unnecessary New Components:**
- NONE - All new components are HRDD-specific and necessary:
  - hrdd-sources.json (config file, cannot reuse)
  - hrdd-prompts.ts (HRDD-specific prompts, cannot reuse conversational prompts)
  - hrdd-state.ts (HRDD-specific state, extends existing pattern)
  - hrdd-preliminary-screening.ts (HRDD-specific logic, no equivalent)
  - hrdd-risk-factors.ts (HRDD-specific logic, no equivalent)
  - hrdd-synthesis.ts (compliance report, different from conversational synthesis)
  - rejected-banner.tsx (HRDD-specific UI, no equivalent)
  - source-warning-banner.tsx (HRDD-specific UI, no equivalent)

**Duplicated Logic:**
- NONE - Spec explicitly notes what to reuse vs create:
  - Reuses: LangGraph patterns, Firecrawl client, markdown renderer, citation tooltips, Radix UI, event streaming
  - Creates: Only HRDD-specific workflow nodes and prompts

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:**
- NONE - Spec section "Reusable Components" (lines 106-148) comprehensively maps existing code to leverage
- Tasks correctly reference existing components (tasks 2.2, 2.9, 3.2, 4.2, 4.3, 5.2-5.3)

**Justification for New Code:**
- Spec section "New Components Required" (lines 130-148) clearly explains why each new component cannot reuse existing code:
  - Config: "Cannot reuse existing: Need domain-specific source lists" (line 135)
  - Workflow: "Cannot directly reuse: HRDD workflow is two-stage vs conversational" (line 139-140)
  - Prompts: "Cannot reuse: Firesearch uses conversational prompts, HRDD needs structured compliance prompts" (line 143)
  - Synthesis: "Cannot reuse: Different output format requirements" (line 147)

## Critical Issues
**Status:** NONE

No critical issues found that would block implementation.

## Minor Issues
**Status:** 2 minor issues identified

1. **Testing Framework Mismatch:**
   - Requirements.md references "no unit test framework currently configured" (line not in excerpt)
   - Tech stack standards specify "Vitest + Playwright" as test framework
   - Tasks reference creating tests but don't specify which framework
   - **Impact:** Minor - Implementer will need to choose test framework (Vitest recommended per standards)
   - **Recommendation:** Add note in Task 1.4 to use Vitest as test framework per standards

2. **Model Configuration Naming:**
   - Spec uses "HRDD_MODEL_CONFIG" (line 1392)
   - Existing codebase uses "MODEL_CONFIG" pattern
   - **Impact:** Very minor - Naming consistency preference
   - **Recommendation:** Consider using consistent naming pattern with existing config.ts

## Over-Engineering Concerns
**STATUS:** NONE

The spec is APPROPRIATELY scoped:

**Configuration-Driven Design:**
- Authoritative sources in JSON config (easily modifiable) - APPROPRIATE
- Prompts as TypeScript constants (version-controlled, explicit) - APPROPRIATE
- Risk thresholds embedded in prompts (auditable, modifiable) - APPROPRIATE

**Component Creation:**
- All new components are HRDD-specific and necessary (no duplicates)
- Extensive reuse of existing Firesearch infrastructure
- No unnecessary abstractions or premature optimization

**Test Coverage:**
- 28-46 tests for feature of this scope - APPROPRIATE
- Focused on critical workflows and acceptance criteria
- No exhaustive edge case coverage (correctly deferred)

**Workflow Complexity:**
- Two-stage assessment (preliminary + enhanced DD) - REQUIRED by HRDD Guide
- Three parallel risk assessments - REQUIRED by HRDD Guide
- Not over-engineered, matches domain requirements

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Tech Stack Alignment
**Status:** PASSED

Spec aligns with tech-stack.md standards:
- Next.js 15 App Router: USED (spec line 6, tasks 3.2)
- React 18: USED (spec line 6)
- TypeScript: USED throughout
- Tailwind CSS: USED (spec line 98)
- shadcn/ui (Radix UI): USED (spec line 98, 121)
- No database for MVP: CORRECT (audit trail to file, not DB)

### Testing Standards Alignment
**Status:** PASSED

Spec aligns with test-writing.md standards:
- **Write Minimal Tests During Development:** COMPLIANT - 2-8 tests per task group
- **Test Only Core User Flows:** COMPLIANT - Tests focus on critical workflows (preliminary screening, risk assessment, report synthesis)
- **Defer Edge Case Testing:** COMPLIANT - Tasks explicitly note "Do NOT test exhaustive edge cases" (multiple tasks)
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation:** COMPLIANT - Tests verify outcomes (risk levels, report structure) not internal logic
- **Mock External Dependencies:** COMPLIANT - Tasks specify mocking Firecrawl and OpenAI responses

### Conventions Alignment
**Status:** PASSED

Spec aligns with conventions.md standards:
- **Consistent Project Structure:** PASSED - File paths organized logically (/config, /lib, /app)
- **Clear Documentation:** PASSED - Extensive prompt templates documented in spec as source of truth
- **Environment Configuration:** PASSED - Uses existing FIRECRAWL_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
- **Version Control Best Practices:** PASSED - Config files version-controlled for audit trail (spec line 1372)

## Recommendations

1. **Specify Test Framework in Task 1.4:**
   - Add: "Use Vitest test framework per standards/testing/test-writing.md"
   - Ensures consistency with project standards

2. **Consider Model Config Naming Consistency:**
   - Current: HRDD_MODEL_CONFIG
   - Consider: Match existing MODEL_CONFIG naming pattern
   - Very minor - not blocking

3. **Add Reference to HRDD Guide File:**
   - Spec references "hrdd-guide.md" throughout
   - Confirm this file exists at /home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/docs/hrdd-guide.md
   - If not, document location or include in spec materials

## Conclusion

**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The HRDD Research Orchestration specification and tasks breakdown are comprehensive, accurate, and well-aligned with user requirements.

**Key Strengths:**
- All 28 user Q&A answers accurately reflected in requirements and spec
- Appropriate reuse of existing Firesearch components (LangGraph, Firecrawl, UI components)
- Focused testing approach (28-46 tests total) aligned with standards
- No over-engineering - all new components are necessary and HRDD-specific
- Clear task breakdown with realistic effort estimates
- Prompt templates as "source of truth" ensure auditability and consistency
- Configuration-driven design allows easy modification without code changes

**Minor Issues:**
- 2 minor issues noted above (test framework specification, naming consistency)
- Neither issue blocks implementation

**Overall Assessment:**
The spec successfully transforms Firesearch into a specialized HRDD assessment tool while maintaining the existing architecture and patterns. The two-week timeline for a single full-stack developer is realistic given the extensive reuse of existing components and focused scope. All user-specified requirements are covered, and the implementation approach is sound.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with implementation. Address minor issues during Task Group 1 setup.
