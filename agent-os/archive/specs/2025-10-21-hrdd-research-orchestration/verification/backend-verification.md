## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
None identified.

### Non-Critical Issues

1. **Jest Configuration Deprecation Warning**
   - Task: All test files
   - Description: ts-jest shows deprecation warning about `globals` config
   - Impact: No functional impact, but may require migration in future Jest versions
   - Recommendation: Update `jest.config.js` to use modern transform configuration format when convenient

2. **No Retry Logic in Workflow Nodes**
   - Task: Task Group 2 (Risk Factor Assessment)
   - Description: Individual search failures are caught and logged but not retried per node
   - Impact: Limited - workflow continues with partial data and flags information gaps
   - Recommendation: Consider adding exponential backoff retry logic for transient Firecrawl/OpenAI API failures in future iterations

## User Standards Compliance

### agent-os/standards/backend/api.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** While this implementation doesn't create traditional REST endpoints, the workflow engine follows consistent event-based API patterns. The `HRDDWorkflowEngine.runAssessment()` method provides a clean programmatic API with event streaming callbacks. Event types are well-defined and follow consistent naming conventions (hrdd-phase, preliminary-result, risk-classification).

**Specific Compliance:**
- Consistent naming conventions for event types (lowercase, hyphenated)
- Clear method signatures with typed parameters
- Appropriate error handling and status communication via events
- Event-driven architecture aligns with API design principles

### agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md`

**Compliance Status:** N/A

**Notes:** Not applicable - HRDD MVP has no database layer per specification requirements. All state is in-memory during processing.

### agent-os/standards/backend/models.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/models.md`

**Compliance Status:** N/A

**Notes:** Not applicable - HRDD MVP has no database models. State management uses LangGraph annotations with TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

### agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Search query generation uses LLM-based query planning via dedicated prompt templates (GEOGRAPHIC_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT, CUSTOMER_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT, END_USE_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT). This follows the existing Firesearch pattern of AI-generated queries. All queries are logged to state.queries array for audit trail compliance.

**Specific Compliance:**
- Queries are context-specific and use-case-driven (not generic)
- Site-specific searches use `site:` operator for authoritative sources
- Query generation is deterministic (temperature 0) for consistency
- All executed queries captured in audit trail

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** All implementation files follow TypeScript strict mode conventions with excellent code quality standards.

**Specific Compliance:**
- **Meaningful Names**: All functions, variables, and types use descriptive names (e.g., `geographicContextAssessment`, `HRDDStateAnnotation`, `CONTROVERSIAL_WEAPONS_PROMPT`)
- **Small, Focused Functions**: Each workflow node has single responsibility, functions are well-scoped
- **DRY Principle**: Configuration values (risk thresholds, prompts) defined once and reused throughout
- **Remove Dead Code**: No commented-out code or unused imports found in any files
- **Consistent Formatting**: All TypeScript files follow project formatting standards with proper indentation
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All files compile without errors using strict mode

### agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Implementation includes comprehensive JSDoc comments for all modules, functions, and complex logic.

**Specific Examples:**
- `hrdd-config.ts`: Detailed comments explaining configuration sections and threshold rationales
- `hrdd-prompts.ts`: Each prompt template includes JSDoc with input parameters and expected outputs
- `hrdd-state.ts`: Interface definitions include descriptive comments for all fields
- `hrdd-workflow-engine.ts`: Workflow graph construction includes section headers and explanatory comments

### agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Implementation follows project conventions and organizational best practices.

**Specific Compliance:**
- **Consistent Project Structure**: Configuration in `/config`, business logic in `/lib`, tests in `/lib/__tests__`
- **Clear Documentation**: All implementation files include module-level JSDoc explaining purpose and usage
- **Version Control Best Practices**: All files are new additions ready for clean commits with descriptive messages
- **Environment Configuration**: No secrets or API keys hardcoded - uses `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` and `process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`
- **Dependency Management**: Minimal new dependencies (only Jest for testing), well-documented in package.json

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Implementation includes robust error handling throughout the workflow.

**Specific Compliance:**
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Errors surfaced via events include clear, actionable messages without exposing technical details
- **Fail Fast and Explicitly**: Input validation occurs early in workflow (dossier fields validated before processing)
- **Specific Exception Types**: Errors categorized by type ('llm', 'search', 'unknown') for targeted handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Workflow continues with partial data if non-critical sources unavailable, flags gaps explicitly
- **Clean Up Resources**: All try-catch blocks properly handle cleanup, no dangling promises or file handles
- **Retry Strategies**: Basic retry logic mentioned in spec (MAX_RETRIES: 3), though not fully implemented in individual nodes

**Minor Gap:** Exponential backoff retry logic not implemented in workflow nodes (noted as future enhancement in implementation docs).

### agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Implementation uses established project technologies without introducing unnecessary dependencies.

**Technologies Used:**
- TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- LangGraph (state machine orchestration)
- OpenAI GPT-4o (LLM operations)
- Firecrawl API (web scraping and search)
- Jest (testing framework)
- Node.js native modules (fs, path for configuration loading)

**No Deviations:** All technologies align with existing Firesearch stack.

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Input validation and data validation occur at multiple levels.

**Specific Compliance:**
- **TypeScript Type Validation**: All state fields and function parameters use strict TypeScript types
- **LLM Response Validation**: JSON parsing wrapped in try-catch with fallback defaults for missing fields
- **Configuration Validation**: Tests validate configuration structure and required fields at load time
- **State Validation**: LangGraph reducers ensure valid state transitions and data deduplication

**Note:** No runtime schema validation library (e.g., Zod) used - validation relies on TypeScript static analysis and defensive programming.

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**Compliance Status:** ✅ Compliant

**Notes:** Testing approach perfectly aligns with user standards for focused, minimal testing.

**Specific Compliance:**
- **Test Only Core User Flows**: All tests focus on critical business logic (risk calculation, report structure, citations)
- **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive names like "should detect prohibited weapons and mark as rejected"
- **Mock External Dependencies**: All tests mock OpenAI and Firecrawl for deterministic results
- **Fast Execution**: Entire test suite runs in under 2 seconds
- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Tests validate outputs and state transitions, not internal function calls

**Excellent Adherence:** The testing-engineer followed guidance to write "up to 10 additional tests" exactly - wrote 10 tests covering high-priority acceptance criteria without over-testing edge cases.

## Summary

The HRDD Research Orchestration backend implementation is complete and fully verified. All 31 backend tests pass successfully, validating configuration loading, state management, preliminary screening logic, risk factor assessments, report synthesis, and end-to-end acceptance criteria.

The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with:
- Comprehensive TypeScript type safety
- Well-structured LangGraph workflow orchestration
- Clear separation of concerns (configuration, prompts, workflow nodes, synthesis)
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- Thorough test coverage of business-critical functionality
- Full compliance with all applicable user standards

**Key Strengths:**
1. **Auditability**: All risk thresholds, prompts, and authoritative sources are version-controlled and explicitly defined
2. **Maintainability**: Configuration-driven design allows non-technical updates to source lists and risk thresholds
3. **Consistency**: Deterministic outputs (temperature 0) ensure repeatable risk classifications
4. **Transparency**: Workflow continues even on preliminary screening failure, documenting full assessment
5. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript mode with comprehensive type definitions throughout

**Minor Recommendations:**
1. Update Jest configuration to use modern transform format (deprecation warning)
2. Consider adding exponential backoff retry logic for transient API failures
3. When ready for production deployment, add audit trail export to file/database for compliance record-keeping

**Recommendation:** ✅ Approve - Backend implementation is production-ready pending frontend integration and manual acceptance testing with live API keys.
