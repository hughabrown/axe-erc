# Task Breakdown: HRDD Research Orchestration

## Overview
Total Tasks: ~50 (organized into 6 task groups)
Estimated Timeline: 2 weeks for single full-stack developer
Assigned Implementers: api-engineer, ui-designer, testing-engineer

**Note on Implementer Selection**: This feature does NOT require database-engineer because there is NO database layer for MVP (file-based audit trail only). The core work involves adapting an existing LangGraph workflow engine, creating configuration files, and modifying frontend components - best handled by api-engineer (backend logic), ui-designer (frontend), and testing-engineer (acceptance tests).

## Task List

### Task Group 1: Configuration & Foundation

**Assigned Implementer:** api-engineer

    - Store as TypeScript template literal constants with typed parameters
    - Include JSDoc comments documenting expected inputs/outputs
    - Export as named constants (e.g., CONTROVERSIAL_WEAPONS_PROMPT, GEOGRAPHIC_RISK_PROMPT)
  - [x] 1.4 Write focused tests for configuration loading
    - Create `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/lib/__tests__/hrdd-config.test.ts`

      - Test all required domains present (geographic_context, customer_profile, end_use_application)
      - Test HRDD_MODEL_CONFIG exports correct values
      - Test prompt templates are defined and non-empty
    - Do NOT test exhaustive validation of all sources or all prompts
  - [x] 1.5 Run configuration tests
    - Execute: `npm run test lib/__tests__/hrdd-config.test.ts`
    - Verify 2-4 configuration tests pass
    - Do NOT run entire test suite at this stage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/config/hrdd-sources.json` created with ~60 sources organized by domain
- `/lib/hrdd-config.ts` exports HRDD_MODEL_CONFIG and HRDD_WORKFLOW_CONFIG

**Total Estimated Duration:** 10-14 days for single full-stack developer (or 6-8 days if work parallelized across specialized implementers)

## Notes

**Why No Database Engineer?**
This HRDD MVP does NOT require database persistence. Audit trail is logged to console/file backend (not database). All assessment logic is stateless (LangGraph in-memory state during processing). Future enhancements may add Supabase for persistent storage of completed assessments, but that is explicitly out of scope for MVP.

**Test-Driven Approach:**
Each task group follows pattern:
1. Write 2-8 focused tests for critical behaviors (x.1 sub-task)
2. Implement functionality (x.2-x.N sub-tasks)
3. Run ONLY those tests to verify (final sub-task)
This ensures incremental validation without running entire test suite repeatedly.

**Prompt Templates as Source of Truth:**
Task Group 1 creates prompt templates from spec. These are NOT "hallucinated" by LLMs during runtime - they are explicit, version-controlled TypeScript constants that implement exact criteria from HRDD Guide Annex 3. This ensures consistency, auditability, and ease of modification.

**Configuration-Driven Design:**
Authoritative sources config (`/config/hrdd-sources.json`) allows ERC team to modify source lists without code changes. Priority levels and paywall flags enable graceful degradation when sources are unavailable.

**Reuse Over Rewrite:**
Tasks explicitly leverage existing Firesearch components:
- LangGraph state machine patterns (lib/langgraph-search-engine.ts)
- Firecrawl API client (lib/firecrawl.ts)
- Citation-aware markdown rendering (app/markdown-renderer.tsx, app/citation-tooltip.tsx)
- Event streaming architecture (SearchEvent types)
- Radix UI components (components/ui/*)

This minimizes new code and focuses effort on HRDD-specific logic (prompts, workflow nodes, risk classification).
