# Task 2: HRDD State Machine & Workflow Logic

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 2 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-21-hrdd-research-orchestration/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Adapt existing LangGraph search engine for two-stage HRDD assessment workflow. This is the core backend logic that orchestrates preliminary screening and enhanced due diligence.

## Implementation Summary

This implementation created a complete LangGraph-based workflow engine for HRDD (Human Rights Due Diligence) assessments. The solution follows the existing Firesearch architecture patterns while introducing HRDD-specific nodes for preliminary screening (weapons, sanctions, jurisdiction checks) and enhanced due diligence (geographic, customer, end-use risk assessments).

The workflow uses GPT-4o with temperature 0 for deterministic outputs, streams real-time progress events to the frontend, and continues to completion even if preliminary screening fails (marking the dossier as REJECTED but completing all assessment phases for documentation purposes).

All 21 focused tests pass, validating state management, preliminary screening logic, risk factor assessments, and report synthesis functionality.

## Key Implementation Details

### HRDD State Annotation
**Location:** `lib/hrdd-state.ts`

Created a comprehensive state structure using LangGraph's `Annotation.Root` pattern. Key fields include:
- **dossier**: Input data (customer, useCase, country)
- **preliminaryScreening**: Results from weapons/sanctions/jurisdiction checks
- **geographicRisk, customerRisk, endUseRisk**: Three risk factor assessments with level, rationale, citations
- **sources**: Array with deduplication reducer (by URL)
- **queries**: Array tracking all executed search queries
- **finalReport**: Synthesized markdown report
- **auditTrail**: Timestamped entries for compliance tracking
- **rejected**: Boolean flag when preliminary screening fails
- **error/errorType**: Error handling fields

**Rationale:** This structure mirrors the existing SearchStateAnnotation pattern from langgraph-search-engine.ts, ensuring consistency while adding HRDD-specific fields. The deduplication reducer prevents duplicate sources in the final report.

### Preliminary Screening Nodes
**Location:** `lib/hrdd-preliminary-screening.ts`

Implemented three sequential nodes that form the first stage of HRDD assessment:

1. **controversialWeaponsCheck**: Uses CONTROVERSIAL_WEAPONS_PROMPT to analyze use case description via LLM. Checks three prohibited categories (nuclear/chemical/biological, cluster munitions/mines, autonomous weapons) and marks state.rejected=true if detected.

2. **sanctionsCheck**: Generates queries for OFAC/UN/EU sanctions databases, executes searches via Firecrawl, uses LLM with SANCTIONS_CHECK_PROMPT to interpret results. Marks rejected if customer sanctioned or country under comprehensive sanctions.

3. **highRiskJurisdictionCheck**: Searches UN/ICC/ICJ/Amnesty/HRW for systematic violations, uses JURISDICTION_PROMPT to assess "automatic high-risk" criteria. Sets preliminaryScreening.outcome to "PASS" or "FAIL" but workflow ALWAYS continues to Enhanced DD.

**Rationale:** The sequential nature ensures each check completes before the next begins. Even if rejected=true, the workflow continues to document full assessment (per spec requirement). Each node emits 'hrdd-phase' and 'searching' events for real-time frontend updates.

### Risk Factor Assessment Nodes
**Location:** `lib/hrdd-risk-factors.ts`

Implemented three nodes that form the Enhanced Due Diligence stage:

1. **geographicContextAssessment**:
   - Generates queries using GEOGRAPHIC_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT (site-specific for Freedom House, Press Freedom, UN reports)
   - Executes up to 20 searches via Firecrawl
   - Uses GEOGRAPHIC_RISK_PROMPT to classify risk based on thresholds (>70 = Low, <40 = High)
   - Returns structured result with Freedom House score, press freedom index, UN investigations, etc.

2. **customerProfileAssessment**:
   - Generates queries using CUSTOMER_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT (customer website, OFAC, adverse media)
   - Searches for ethics policies, UNGP adoption, compliance violations
   - Uses CUSTOMER_RISK_PROMPT to classify based on governance, transparency, ESG reporting

3. **endUseAssessment**:
   - Generates USE-CASE-SPECIFIC queries (not generic) using technical terms from use case description
   - Searches autonomous weapons frameworks, dual-use controls, defense media
   - Uses END_USE_RISK_PROMPT to assess three dimensions: human control level, proximity to harm, repurposing ease

**Rationale:** Each node follows a consistent pattern: (1) generate targeted queries via LLM, (2) execute searches, (3) analyze results with LLM, (4) return structured risk classification. This modular design allows independent testing and future modification of individual risk factors.

### Report Synthesis Node
**Location:** `lib/hrdd-synthesis.ts`

Implements final report generation with these key features:
- Calculates overallRisk as highest of three risk factors (if any is High, overall is High)
- Uses FINAL_REPORT_GENERATION_PROMPT with GPT-4o streaming to generate markdown
- Ensures EVERY factual claim has [source_id] citation matching the sources list
- Includes REJECTED banner if state.rejected=true
- Includes warning banner if critical sources unavailable
- Generates structured sections: Executive Summary, Dossier, Preliminary Screening, Enhanced DD (3 sections), Risk Classification, Recommended Conditions, Information Gaps, Citations

**Rationale:** Streaming LLM response allows frontend to display report incrementally. The "highest risk wins" calculation ensures conservative risk classification. Explicit citation format [1], [2], etc. enables citation tooltips in the frontend.

### LangGraph Workflow Engine
**Location:** `lib/hrdd-workflow-engine.ts`

Integrated all nodes into a LangGraph state machine with this flow:
```
START
  → controversialWeaponsCheck
  → sanctionsCheck
  → highRiskJurisdictionCheck
  → geographicContextAssessment
  → customerProfileAssessment
  → endUseAssessment
  → synthesizeReport
  → END
```

Key features:
- Conditional edges for error handling (routes to handleError node if state.error is set)
- Event streaming via eventCallback for frontend progress tracking
- Audit trail captures all queries, sources, timestamps, LLM responses
- Recursion limit set to 50 (higher than conversational search due to more nodes)
- Uses HRDDStateAnnotation for type-safe state management

**Rationale:** Sequential flow (not parallel) ensures each phase completes before next begins, allowing frontend to display progress linearly. The workflow ALWAYS executes all nodes even if rejected=true, fulfilling the spec requirement that "workflow continues to completion even if preliminary screening fails."

## Database Changes (if applicable)

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### agent-os/standards/backend/api.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The workflow engine exposes event streaming via `runAssessment(dossier, onEvent)` method, following the existing Firesearch pattern of Server Actions calling workflow engines. All nodes use consistent error handling via state.error field and conditional routing. HTTP-like event types ('hrdd-phase', 'searching', 'found', 'final-result') mirror the conversational search event structure.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - the implementation follows existing API patterns from langgraph-search-engine.ts rather than creating new REST endpoints.

### agent-os/standards/backend/models.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Not applicable - HRDD MVP has no database persistence. All state management uses in-memory LangGraph state during processing.

**Deviations (if any):**
N/A - no database models created per spec requirements.

### agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Search query generation uses LLM-based query planning via GEOGRAPHIC_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT, CUSTOMER_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT, and END_USE_QUERY_GENERATION_PROMPT. This follows the "AI-generated queries" pattern from the existing search engine. Queries are stored in state.queries array for audit trail compliance.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - query generation follows the same LLM-based approach as the conversational search engine.

### agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All files use TypeScript strict mode with explicit type annotations (HRDDState, GeographicRiskResult, etc.). Functions are small and focused (each node has single responsibility). DRY principle followed by extracting common patterns (event emission, LLM invocation, search execution). Meaningful names used (geographicContextAssessment vs gcAssess).

**Deviations (if any):**
None - code follows TypeScript/JavaScript naming conventions and existing Firesearch patterns.

### agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Each node wraps LLM/search operations in try-catch blocks and returns error state (`return { error: string, errorType: 'llm' | 'search' | 'unknown' }`). The workflow uses conditional edges to route errors to handleError node. Errors are emitted as events for frontend display. Resources are properly cleaned up (no dangling promises or file handles).

**Deviations (if any):**
Retry logic for failed searches is mentioned in spec but not implemented in this task group (deferred to integration testing). Each node fails fast on critical errors.

### agent-os/standards/global/validation.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Input validation occurs at dossier level (checked in tests). LLM responses are validated via JSON parsing with try-catch. Missing fields in parsed JSON default to safe values (e.g., confidence: 0 if not provided). State updates validate types via TypeScript strict mode.

**Deviations (if any):**
No runtime schema validation library used (e.g., Zod) - validation relies on TypeScript static analysis and try-catch for JSON parsing.

### agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md
**How Your Implementation Complies:**
All tests follow "Arrange-Act-Assert" pattern. Mocks use jest.mock() for dependencies (@langchain/openai, Firecrawl). Each test file focuses on a single module (state, preliminary, risk-factors, synthesis). Test names clearly describe what is being tested ("should detect prohibited weapons and mark as rejected"). Tests are deterministic with mocked responses.

**Deviations (if any):**
None - focused testing approach followed per spec requirement (2-6 tests per sub-task, not exhaustive coverage).

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
No new HTTP endpoints created. Workflow engine is invoked programmatically:
```typescript
const engine = new HRDDWorkflowEngine(firecrawl);
await engine.runAssessment(dossier, onEvent);
```

### External Services
- **Firecrawl API** - Used for search operations via `firecrawl.search(query, options)`
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** - Used for all LLM operations (query generation, risk classification, report synthesis) via ChatOpenAI with temperature=0

### Internal Dependencies
- `lib/hrdd-config.ts` - Configuration constants (HRDD_MODEL_CONFIG, HRDD_WORKFLOW_CONFIG)
- `lib/hrdd-prompts.ts` - All 10 prompt templates
- `config/hrdd-sources.json` - Authoritative sources configuration (60 sources)
- `lib/firecrawl.ts` - Existing Firecrawl client wrapper
- `@langchain/langgraph` - State machine orchestration
- `@langchain/openai` - LLM integration

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified during implementation or testing.

### Limitations
1. **No Retry Logic for Failed Searches**
   - Description: Individual search failures are caught and logged but not retried
   - Reason: Focused implementation defers retry logic to integration testing phase
   - Future Consideration: Add retry logic with exponential backoff in risk factor nodes

2. **No Parallel Execution of Risk Assessments**
   - Description: Geographic, customer, and end-use assessments run sequentially
   - Reason: Simplifies error handling and frontend progress display
   - Future Consideration: Use LangGraph parallel edges to run three risk assessments concurrently

3. **No Persistent Audit Trail**
   - Description: Audit trail exists in state but is not persisted to database or file
   - Reason: MVP spec requires console/file logging only (no database)
   - Future Consideration: Add audit trail export to JSON file after workflow completion

4. **Mock-Based Testing Only**
   - Description: All tests use mocked LLM/Firecrawl responses
   - Reason: Focused testing approach per spec requirements
   - Future Consideration: Add integration tests with real API calls in Task Group 6

## Performance Considerations

- **Processing Time**: Workflow can take up to 1 hour for complete assessment (per spec target). Sequential execution of 7 nodes with 15-20 searches per risk factor = ~60-100 total searches.
- **LLM Token Usage**: Each risk assessment generates queries (500 tokens), analyzes results (2000 tokens max), and synthesizes report (4096 tokens max) = ~7000 tokens per assessment. Total workflow: ~25,000-30,000 tokens.
- **Deduplication**: Sources deduplicated by URL in reducer to minimize redundant processing in synthesis node.
- **Streaming**: Report synthesis uses streaming LLM response to provide incremental progress to frontend.

No performance bottlenecks identified in testing (mocked dependencies complete in <2 seconds per test).

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: OpenAI and Firecrawl API keys read from environment variables (process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY, process.env.FIRECRAWL_API_KEY)
- **Input Sanitization**: Dossier fields (customer, useCase, country) inserted into LLM prompts via template replacement - no SQL injection risk (no database), minimal prompt injection risk (GPT-4o has built-in safety)
- **Citation Validation**: Report synthesis validates that all [source_id] references map to actual sources in state.sources array
- **Error Messages**: Error messages sanitized to avoid exposing API keys or internal paths (state.error contains user-friendly messages)

No security vulnerabilities identified. Future enhancement: Add rate limiting for LLM/Firecrawl API calls to prevent abuse.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

Task Group 3, 4, 5 (Frontend) depend on:
- Event types exported from hrdd-preliminary-screening.ts and hrdd-risk-factors.ts
- HRDDWorkflowEngine.runAssessment() method signature
- HRDDEvent type union for event handling in chat.tsx

Task Group 6 (Testing) depends on:
- Complete workflow implementation for end-to-end testing
- All 21 focused tests passing as baseline

## Notes

**Test-Driven Approach:**
Implementation followed the test-driven pattern specified in tasks.md:
1. Write focused tests (2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7)
2. Implement functionality (2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9)
3. Run tests to verify (2.10)

This ensured each node was validated incrementally before integration into the full workflow.

**LangGraph Pattern Reuse:**
The workflow engine closely mirrors the existing langgraph-search-engine.ts structure:
- Annotation.Root for state management
- Node functions with (state, config) signature
- Conditional edges for error handling
- Event streaming via eventCallback
- Source deduplication via Map reducer

This consistency minimizes learning curve for developers and ensures the HRDD workflow integrates seamlessly with the existing Firesearch architecture.

**Prompt Template Integration:**
All prompts are imported from hrdd-prompts.ts (created in Task Group 1) and used with string replacement (e.g., `.replace('{customer}', state.dossier.customer)`). This keeps prompts version-controlled and auditable, avoiding "hallucinated" LLM-generated prompts.

**Deterministic Outputs:**
All LLM calls use `temperature: 0` from HRDD_MODEL_CONFIG to ensure consistent risk classifications across multiple runs of the same dossier. This is critical for compliance and auditability.

**Continuation After Rejection:**
The workflow ALWAYS completes all 7 nodes even if state.rejected=true. This fulfills the spec requirement: "Workflow continues to completion even if preliminary screening fails (marks REJECTED)." The final report includes a prominent REJECTED banner but still shows full Enhanced DD results for documentation purposes.
