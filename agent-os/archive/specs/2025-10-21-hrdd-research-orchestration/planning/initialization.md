# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description

**Feature Name**: HRDD Research Orchestration

**Description**: Adapt Firesearch to accept dossier input (customer, use case, deployment country) and generate research queries aligned with HRDD Guide methodology. Target specific authoritative sources from sites.md for each of the three risk factors: Geographic Context (Freedom House, Press Freedom Index, UN reports), Customer Profile (sanctions databases, adverse media, corporate registries), and End-Use Application (autonomous weapons frameworks, dual-use controls). Existing Firecrawl integration handles parallel search and content extraction with citations.

**Context from Roadmap**:
- This is MVP Item #1 (Large effort, 2 weeks)
- Foundation: Firesearch already provides citation tracking, source metadata capture, parallel search orchestration, and answer validation
- The HRDD adaptation focuses on customizing prompts for compliance workflows and outputting structured assessment reports
