# Task 8: Multi-Pass Node Integration

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #8 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-23-hybrid-rag-multi-pass-synthesis/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Pending Test Execution 8.7)

### Task Description
Integrate the multi-pass synthesis system into the LangGraph workflow by replacing the old single-pass synthesize node with a new multiPassSynthesize node that orchestrates all 4 passes (Overview, Deep Dive, Cross-Reference, Final Report) with event streaming and citation validation.

## Implementation Summary

This task completed the integration of the multi-pass synthesis architecture into the LangGraph search engine workflow. The implementation replaced the old single-pass synthesize node with a comprehensive multiPassSynthesize node that:

1. **Orchestrates all 4 synthesis passes** in sequence: Pass 1 (outline generation), Pass 2 (deep dive with full content), Pass 3 (cross-reference validation), and Pass 4 (final report generation).

2. **Streams progress events** to the frontend for real-time user feedback on which pass is executing and what it's analyzing.

3. **Validates citations** after Pass 4 to ensure reports meet the 50+ citation requirement.

4. **Integrates seamlessly** with the existing LangGraph state machine using the established patterns for state management, event callbacks, and error handling.

The implementation follows the spec's architecture (lines 1090-1299) and maintains compatibility with the existing search workflow while enabling the production of comprehensive, deeply-researched reports with 50+ citations and 5-10k word counts.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
None - All new functionality was added to existing files or previously created modules.

### Modified Files
- `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/lib/langgraph-search-engine.ts` - Added multi-pass state fields, removed old synthesize node, implemented new multiPassSynthesize node, updated workflow edges (major changes ~200 lines)
- `/home/hughbrown/code/firecrawl/firesearch/agent-os/specs/2025-10-23-hybrid-rag-multi-pass-synthesis/tasks.md` - Marked subtasks 8.2-8.6 as complete

### Deleted Files
None - Old synthesize node code was replaced inline rather than removed entirely to maintain git history.

## Key Implementation Details

### State Extension (Task 8.2)
**Location:** `/lib/langgraph-search-engine.ts` lines 149-171

Added three new state fields to SearchStateAnnotation:

1. **multiPassState** - Tracks the current pass number, outline, findings, validation report, and information gaps
   ```typescript
   multiPassState: Annotation<{
     currentPass: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
     outline: OutlineStructure | null;
     deepDiveFindings: SectionFindings[] | null;
     validationReport: ValidationReport | null;
     informationGaps: string[] | null;
   } | null>
   ```

2. **citationMap** - Stores citation usage data for validation
   ```typescript
   citationMap: Annotation<Map<string, CitationUsage>>
   ```

3. **fullContentStore** - Maintains the content store throughout the workflow
   ```typescript
   fullContentStore: Annotation<IContentStore>
   ```

**Rationale:** These fields enable the multi-pass synthesis pipeline to maintain state between passes and provide comprehensive citation tracking, following the reducer pattern established in the codebase for last-write-wins semantics.

### Old Synthesize Node Removal (Task 8.3)
**Location:** `/lib/langgraph-search-engine.ts` (original lines ~708-754 replaced)

Removed the old single-pass synthesize node that used `generateStreamingAnswer()` directly. The node was replaced entirely with the new multiPassSynthesize node.

**Rationale:** The old node couldn't support the multi-pass architecture required for comprehensive report generation. Complete replacement ensures no confusion about which synthesis path is active.

### MultiPassSynthesize Node Implementation (Task 8.4)
**Location:** `/lib/langgraph-search-engine.ts` lines 764-916

Implemented comprehensive multi-pass synthesis node that:

**Pass 1 - Overview (lines 779-799):**
- Calls `generateOutline()` from multi-pass-synthesis module
- Uses source summaries to identify 5-8 major themes
- Emits 'multi-pass-phase' and 'outline-generated' events

**Pass 2 - Deep Dive (lines 801-826):**
- Loops through all outline sections
- Calls `processSection()` for each section with full content from ContentStore
- Emits 'deep-dive-section' event for each section processed

**Pass 3 - Cross-Reference (lines 828-851):**
- Calls `validateFindings()` with all findings from Pass 2
- Detects conflicts between sources
- Emits 'conflict-detected' events for each conflict found

**Pass 4 - Final Report (lines 853-873):**
- Calls `generateFinalReport()` with streaming callback
- Generates comprehensive markdown report
- Streams content chunks to frontend via 'content-chunk' events

**Citation Validation (lines 875-885):**
- Creates CitationValidator instance
- Parses report to extract all [url] citations
- Validates against minimum requirements (50+ citations)
- Emits 'citation-stats' event with results

**Follow-up Questions (lines 887-893):**
- Reuses existing `generateFollowUpQuestions()` logic
- Maintains compatibility with conversation flow

**Rationale:** This architecture enables comprehensive report generation while providing real-time progress updates to users. The sequential execution ensures each pass has access to the results of previous passes.

### Event Streaming Implementation (Task 8.5)
**Location:** Throughout multiPassSynthesize node (lines 764-916)

Added five new event types for multi-pass synthesis:

1. **'multi-pass-phase'** - Emitted at start of each pass (1, 2, 3, 4)
2. **'outline-generated'** - Emitted after Pass 1 with outline structure
3. **'deep-dive-section'** - Emitted for each section in Pass 2
4. **'conflict-detected'** - Emitted for each conflict found in Pass 3
5. **'citation-stats'** - Emitted after citation validation with stats

**Rationale:** These events enable the frontend to display real-time progress and give users visibility into what the system is analyzing at each stage, improving the UX for long-running synthesis operations.

### Workflow Edge Updates (Task 8.6)
**Location:** `/lib/langgraph-search-engine.ts` lines 1015-1035

Updated conditional edges to route to new multiPassSynthesize node:

**From analyze node (lines 1015-1027):**
```typescript
.addConditionalEdges(
  "analyze",
  (state: SearchState) => {
    if (state.phase === 'error') return "handleError";
    if (state.phase === 'planning') return "plan";
    return "multiPassSynthesize"; // CHANGED from "synthesize"
  },
  {
    handleError: "handleError",
    plan: "plan",
    multiPassSynthesize: "multiPassSynthesize" // CHANGED
  }
)
```

**From multiPassSynthesize to complete (lines 1028-1035):**
```typescript
.addConditionalEdges(
  "multiPassSynthesize",
  (state: SearchState) => state.phase === 'error' ? "handleError" : "complete",
  {
    handleError: "handleError",
    complete: "complete"
  }
)
```

**Rationale:** These edge updates ensure the workflow correctly routes from analysis → multi-pass synthesis → completion, while maintaining error handling paths.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Backend API Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The multiPassSynthesize node follows the established LangGraph node pattern: async function accepting `state` and `config` parameters, returning `Partial<SearchState>`. Error handling uses try-catch with proper error type categorization ('llm' errors). Event callbacks are accessed via `config?.configurable?.eventCallback` following the existing pattern.

**Deviations:** None

### Backend Models Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/models.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
State annotations use the established reducer pattern with `Annotation.Root()`. The multiPassState field uses last-write-wins semantics `(_, y) => y`, while citationMap uses null-coalescing `(_, y) => y ?? new Map()`. Type inference is preserved with proper TypeScript types for all state fields.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Code uses TypeScript strict mode with explicit type annotations. Functions have clear names describing their purpose (generateOutline, processSection, validateFindings, generateFinalReport). Imports are organized at the top of the file. Consistent indentation and formatting throughout.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Error Handling Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The multiPassSynthesize node includes a comprehensive try-catch block that captures errors, logs them to console, and returns proper error state with errorType: 'llm' and phase: 'error'. This allows the workflow to route to the handleError node for retry logic.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Conventions Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Imports are added at the top of the file for multi-pass-synthesis, citation-validator, and content-store modules. Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (following SYNTHESIS_CONFIG pattern). Event types follow existing naming convention ('multi-pass-phase', 'outline-generated', etc.). State field names use camelCase.

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
Not applicable - This implementation is backend-only within the LangGraph workflow.

### External Services
- **OpenAI GPT-4o API** - Called via LangChain's ChatOpenAI for Pass 1-4
- **Firecrawl API** - Content already retrieved in earlier nodes (search/scrape)

### Internal Dependencies
- **multi-pass-synthesis module** (`/lib/multi-pass-synthesis.ts`) - Provides generateOutline, processSection, validateFindings, generateFinalReport functions
- **citation-validator module** (`/lib/citation-validator.ts`) - Provides CitationValidator class for tracking and validating citations
- **content-store module** (`/lib/content-store.ts`) - Provides IContentStore interface and InMemoryContentStore implementation
- **context-processor module** (`/lib/context-processor.ts`) - Provides processSources for analysis phase (unchanged)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified at this stage.

### Limitations
1. **Private Field Access**
   - Description: CitationValidator's citationMap is private but needs to be accessed for state storage
   - Impact: Low - Works with bracket notation `citationValidator['citationMap']`
   - Reason: TypeScript doesn't allow public accessor for Map field that should be encapsulated
   - Future Consideration: Add a `getCitationMap()` method to CitationValidator class for cleaner access

2. **Test Execution Deferred**
   - Description: Task 8.7 (test execution) is not yet complete
   - Impact: Medium - Integration tests haven't validated the implementation
   - Reason: Following task breakdown that separates implementation from test execution
   - Future Consideration: Run tests in Task 8.7 to validate all 4 passes execute correctly

## Performance Considerations

The multi-pass synthesis pipeline executes 4 LLM calls sequentially:
- **Pass 1:** GPT-4o-mini for outline (~5 min)
- **Pass 2:** GPT-4o for N sections (one call per section) (~15 min total)
- **Pass 3:** GPT-4o for validation (~10 min)
- **Pass 4:** GPT-4o streaming for final report (~10 min)

**Total estimated time:** ~40 minutes per search

**Optimization opportunities:**
- Pass 2 sections could be parallelized (currently sequential)
- Token usage monitoring could enable early termination if approaching limits
- Caching of outlines/findings could speed up retries

## Security Considerations

- API keys are accessed via environment variables (process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY)
- No user input is directly passed to LLMs without being part of structured prompts
- Citation URLs are sanitized through regex parsing to prevent injection
- State data is ephemeral (cleared after search completion)

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

**Task 9 (UI Updates)** depends on this implementation:
- Event types ('multi-pass-phase', 'outline-generated', etc.) must be handled in frontend
- Citation stats need to be displayed in UI
- Progress messages for each pass need UI components

**Task 10 (Testing)** depends on this implementation:
- Integration tests will verify all 4 passes execute
- Acceptance tests will validate 50+ citations, 5-10k word reports
- Performance tests will measure total processing time

## Notes

1. **Event Type Compatibility:** All new event types were added to the existing SearchEvent union type to maintain type safety throughout the application.

2. **Backward Compatibility:** The implementation maintains compatibility with existing workflow nodes (understand, plan, search, scrape, analyze, complete, handleError) - only the synthesize node was replaced.

3. **State Initialization:** The initialState in the search() method now includes multiPassState: null, citationMap: new Map(), and fullContentStore: new InMemoryContentStore() to ensure proper initialization.

4. **Error Propagation:** Errors in any pass will set phase to 'error' and route to handleError node, maintaining existing retry logic.

5. **Content Store Lifecycle:** The ContentStore is initialized at the start of each search and persists throughout all phases, enabling Pass 2 to retrieve full content stored during the search/scrape phases.

6. **Citation Validation Timing:** Citation validation occurs after Pass 4 completes but before returning state, ensuring the citationMap is populated with all extracted citations.

7. **Follow-up Questions:** The existing generateFollowUpQuestions() method is reused, ensuring consistency with the previous implementation and conversation flow.

8. **Streaming Compatibility:** The streaming callback for Pass 4 maintains compatibility with the existing frontend implementation that expects 'content-chunk' events.
