## 3. Roadmap Updates

**Status:** ⚠️ No Updates Needed

### Analysis

The product roadmap (`agent-os/product/roadmap.md`) focuses on HRDD (Human Rights Due Diligence) feature development, which is a separate domain-specific application built on top of Firesearch's core search engine capabilities.

The Hybrid RAG Architecture with Multi-Pass Synthesis is a **foundational enhancement** to the core search engine, not a roadmap feature item. It improves the underlying synthesis pipeline that all Firesearch features (including HRDD) leverage.

### Relevant Roadmap Context

The roadmap mentions "citation tracking" and "RAG assessment" as existing Firesearch foundation capabilities:

```markdown
Foundation: Firesearch already provides citation tracking, source metadata capture,
parallel search orchestration, and answer validation.
```

This spec enhances those foundation capabilities from 11 citations to 50+ citations and from single-pass to multi-pass synthesis.

### Roadmap Items

No specific roadmap items correspond to this spec. The enhancement benefits all current and future features:
- Item 1 (HRDD Research Orchestration) - Benefits from improved citation depth
- Item 2 (Structured HRDD Report with RAG Assessment) - Benefits from multi-pass synthesis quality
- Item 14 (Custom Research Queries) - Benefits from enhanced citation standards

### Notes

This is a **platform improvement** rather than a feature delivery. No roadmap checkboxes require updating.
