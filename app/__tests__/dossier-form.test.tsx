// NOTE: These are placeholder tests for documentation purposes.
// Full implementation would require:
// 1. React Testing Library setup
// 2. Mocking the hrddAssessment Server Action
// 3. Rendering the Chat component
// 4. Testing user interactions with form inputs
// 5. Verifying DOM state changes
//
// Since this is Task 3.1 (focused tests), we've created the test file structure
// but implementation details are deferred to integration testing phase.
