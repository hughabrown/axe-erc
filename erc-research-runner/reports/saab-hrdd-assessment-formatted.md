# HRDD Assessment: SAAB AB - AI-Powered Reconnaissance Drones

**Customer:** SAAB AB

**Assessment Date:** 2025-10-27

**Assessed By:** ERC Research Team

---

## Executive Summary

### Overall Recommendation: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS (ðŸŸ¡ Medium-Low Risk)

We recommend proceeding with SAAB AB for AI-powered reconnaissance drone technology, subject to enhanced monitoring and contractual safeguards. SAAB is a publicly-traded Swedish defense company operating in one of the world's most transparent regulatory environments, with strong ESG commitments and comprehensive export controls. The proposed reconnaissance systems maintain meaningful human control and do not constitute autonomous weapons under international law. While an ongoing U.S. DOJ investigation into a 2014 Brazil fighter jet deal and the dual-use nature of AI technology present moderate risks, these are substantially mitigated by Sweden's robust legal framework, SAAB's transparent governance, and the availability of technical and contractual controls. The primary risks are reputational (pending investigation) and technological (potential misuse), both addressable through conditions outlined below.

### Summary of Findings

#### Stage 1: Preliminary Screening â€” **ðŸŸ¢ PASS**

**Controversial Weapons:** SAAB explicitly prohibits involvement with anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, and biological/chemical weapons per their [Export Compliance policy](https://www.saab.com/sustainability/resilient-and-safe-societies/export-compliance). Independent verification by [Ethos ESG](https://www.ethosesg.com/companies/6131) and [European defence ETF analysis](https://www.wisdomtree.eu/api/sitecore/pdf/getblogpdf?id=f1fa5ff5-f0a5-486c-8e7c-4b949ee8e87f) confirms no controversial weapons involvement.

**Sanctions Status:** SAAB AB does not appear on [OFAC](https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/sdnew07.pdf), [EU](https://data.europa.eu/apps/eusanctionstracker/entities/), or UN sanctions lists. Headquartered in Stockholm, Swedenâ€”an EU/NATO member state with strong rule of law.

**Export Controls:** All SAAB defense exports are reviewed by Sweden's [Inspectorate for Strategic Products (ISP)](https://www.ekn.se/en/ekn-magazine/ekns-magazine/in-defence-of-defence/), which ensures compliance with Swedish and international regulations.

**Key Decision:** No automatic disqualifiers identified. Proceed to enhanced due diligence.

---

#### Risk Factor 1: Geographic & Regulatory Context â€” **ðŸŸ¢ LOW RISK**

**Jurisdiction Assessment:** Sweden provides an exemplary regulatory environment for defense technology deployment:

- **Democracy & Rights:** Ranked as "Free" by Freedom House, #3 globally for press freedom, and among top 5 for low corruption (Transparency International). Full democracy with independent judiciary and strong civil liberties.

- **AI Governance:** Subject to the [EU Artificial Intelligence Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/high-level-summary/), which classifies military AI as high-risk, requires transparency/human oversight, and mandates risk management. Sweden's ISP reviews all defense exports with human rights and IHL compliance criteria.

- **Export Framework:** Government approval required for all defense exports, with mandatory end-use certificates and post-shipment verification programs.

**Key Finding:** Sweden's multi-layered regulatory framework (EU AI Act, Swedish export controls, NATO commitments) provides strong institutional safeguards minimizing geographic deployment risk.

---

#### Risk Factor 2: Customer Profile & Business Activities â€” **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK**

**Corporate Structure:** SAAB AB is a [publicly-traded company](https://www.saab.com/about/corporate-governance) (Nasdaq Stockholm: SAAB B) founded in 1937, with 26,122 employees and ~SEK 51 billion revenue (2024). Ownership includes ~70% institutional investors, Swedish government strategic influence, and Wallenberg sphere (Investor AB) participation. [Source: Simply Wall St](https://simplywall.st/stocks/se/capital-goods/sto-saab-b/saab-shares/ownership)

**ESG Performance:** [Ethos ESG rating](https://www.ethosesg.com/companies/6131) of C (51.5/100)â€”average performer with strong scores in Accountable Institutions (A), Equal Pay & Opportunity (A), and Decent Work (A). Committed to net-zero emissions by 2040 and CDP Climate Change disclosure (B rating).

**Governance Strengths:**
- UN Global Compact signatory (since 2010)
- Comprehensive [Code of Conduct](https://www.saab.com/contentassets/fc199a4996d44dc288eb29624047ba67/saab-code-of-conduct.pdf) and [Human Rights Policy](https://www.saab.com/sustainability/resilient-and-safe-societies/business-and-human-rights)
- Export compliance framework includes IHL review
- No exclusions from Norwegian sovereign wealth fund

**Areas of Concern:**

1. **Ongoing DOJ Investigation (October 2024):** U.S. DOJ issued subpoena regarding Brazil's 2014 Gripen fighter acquisition (~$5.4B, 36 aircraft). Brazilian and Swedish authorities previously investigated; both closed without charges. SAAB [publicly disclosed](https://www.saab.com/newsroom/press-releases/2024/u.s.-department-of-justice-requests-information-from-saab-north-america-inc.-regarding-brazils-acquisition-of-gripen-fighters-in-2014) the DOJ request and stated cooperation. No charges filed to date. [Sources: Stanford FCPA](https://fcpa.stanford.edu/investigation.html?id=460), [Corruption Tracker](https://corruption-tracker.org/case/brazils-gripen-influence-case)

2. **Historical Issues:** Allegations regarding 1990s-2000s Gripen sales to Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa. These pre-date current governance framework with no recent recurrence. [Source: Corruption Tracker](https://corruption-tracker.org/case/gripen-combat-aircraft-sales-to-the-czech-republic-and-hungary)

3. **Reputational Association:** 2025 ABC News Australia report linked SAAB to human rights concerns at Woomera Detention Centre due to adjacent missile testing range operations. No direct involvement in detention operations.

**Key Finding:** Strong governance and transparency, but ongoing investigation creates reputational risk requiring enhanced monitoring until resolved. SAAB's proactive disclosure and previous exonerations are positive indicators.

---

#### Risk Factor 3: End-Use Application (AI Reconnaissance Drones) â€” **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK**

**Application Description:** AI-powered reconnaissance drones for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions with human-in-the-loop control.

**Autonomous Weapons Assessment:** The proposed system does NOT qualify as a Lethal Autonomous Weapon System (LAWS) under international definitions:

- **ICRC Definition:** "Weapon systems that select and apply force to targets without human intervention in the critical functions." [Source: ICRC](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2018/08/15/autonomous-weapons-operationalizing-meaningful-human-control/)

- **Our Assessment:** System does NOT meet LAWS definition because:
  - No force application capability (reconnaissance only)
  - Humans control target identification/classification
  - Operator approval required for mission-critical decisions
  - AI assists with data processing, not attack decisions

- **UN CCW Compliance:** Aligns with "meaningful human control" principles: predictable behavior, human understanding of environment, human ability to intervene, and human responsibility for decisions. [Source: UN LAWS](https://disarmament.unoda.org/en/our-work/emerging-challenges/lethal-autonomous-weapon-systems)

**IHL Compliance:** Reconnaissance systems can enhance IHL compliance by:
- Improving distinction between military objectives and civilians
- Supporting proportionality assessments with better intelligence
- Enabling precautionary measures through improved situational awareness
- Maintaining clear chain of command and human accountability

[Sources: ICRC AI Targeting (2024)](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2024/09/04/the-risks-and-inefficacies-of-ai-systems-in-military-targeting-support/), [SIPRI Bias Study](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/0825_ai_military_bias.pdf)

**Dual-Use Technology Risks:**

*Concerns:*
- AI systems could theoretically be adapted for autonomous targeting
- Software updates could change system behavior
- Technology reverse-engineering and proliferation risks

*Mitigations Available:*
- **Technical:** Hardware limitations on autonomous operation, software architecture requiring human approval, tamper-evident design, kill-switch mechanisms
- **Contractual:** End-use certificates, no re-transfer clauses, post-delivery verification rights, mandatory IHL training, incident reporting
- **Regulatory:** Swedish ISP export license, EU AI Act compliance, ongoing regulatory monitoring

**Key Finding:** While reconnaissance drones maintain meaningful human control and comply with IHL, the dual-use nature of AI technology requires strict end-use monitoring and technical safeguards to prevent weaponization.

---

### Conclusion

SAAB AB represents a qualified partner for AI reconnaissance drone technology. The combination of Sweden's exemplary regulatory environment, SAAB's transparent corporate governance, and the non-autonomous nature of the proposed systems provides a solid foundation for engagement. The primary risksâ€”a pending DOJ investigation and dual-use technology concernsâ€”are manageable through the conditions outlined above. We recommend approval subject to these conditions, with quarterly reviews during the investigation period and annual reviews thereafter.

The proposed system is NOT an autonomous weapon system under international law definitions because:

1. **Target Selection:** Humans make all targeting decisions
2. **Attack Authorization:** Meaningful human control maintained at critical junctions
3. **Use of Force:** AI does not independently apply force; reconnaissance only
4. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Operator approval required for all mission-critical decisions

**Comparison to LAWS Definitions:**

**ICRC Definition of AWS:**
[Source: ICRC Blog on Autonomous Weapons](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2018/08/15/autonomous-weapons-operationalizing-meaningful-human-control/)
"Weapon systems that select and apply force to targets without human intervention in the critical functions."

**Assessment:** The proposed reconnaissance drones do NOT meet this definition because:
- No force application capability (reconnaissance only)
- Human control over target identification and classification
- Humans determine operational parameters and missions
- AI assists with data processing, not attack decisions

**UN CCW Framework:**
[Source: UN Office for Disarmament Affairs - LAWS](https://disarmament.unoda.org/en/our-work/emerging-challenges/lethal-autonomous-weapon-systems)
The system aligns with "meaningful human control" principles:
- Predictable system behavior
- Human understanding of operational environment
- Human ability to intervene
- Human responsibility for use-of-force decisions

#### IHL Compliance

**Distinction:**
- Reconnaissance systems enable better distinction between military objectives and civilians
- AI-enhanced target identification can improve compliance with distinction principle
- Human verification of AI-generated target classifications ensures IHL compliance

**Proportionality:**
- Reconnaissance data supports proportionality assessments
- Human decision-makers retain ability to assess collateral damage
- AI provides information; humans make proportionality judgments

**Precautions in Attack:**
- Enhanced ISR capabilities enable better precautionary measures
- Improved situational awareness reduces risk of civilian harm
- Human control ensures precautions remain effective

**Accountability:**
- Clear chain of command maintained
- Human operators remain responsible under IHL
- Systems designed for transparency and traceability

#### Dual-Use Technology Guidelines

**Risk Assessment: MODERATE**

**Potential Concerns:**

1. **Technology Transfer Risk:**
   - AI systems could be adapted for autonomous targeting
   - Software updates could change system behavior
   - Need for end-use monitoring

2. **Proliferation Risk:**
   - Technology could be reverse-engineered
   - Might set precedent for less controlled applications
   - Export control critical

**Mitigation Measures:**

1. **Technical Safeguards:**
   - Hardware limitations on autonomous operation
   - Software architecture requiring human approval
   - Tamper-evident design
   - Kill-switch mechanisms

2. **Contractual Safeguards:**
   - End-use certificates required
   - No re-transfer without approval
   - Post-delivery verification rights
   - Training on IHL compliance
   - Incident reporting requirements

3. **Regulatory Safeguards:**
   - Swedish ISP export license required
   - EU AI Act compliance documentation
   - Ongoing monitoring by regulatory authorities

**EU Export Control:**
- Dual-use items regulation (EU 2021/821)
- Military goods directive
- Swedish national controls (ISP oversight)

**Wassenaar Arrangement:**
- Sweden is member state
- Export controls for conventional arms and dual-use goods
- Information sharing on transfers

**Sources:**
- EU Dual-Use Regulation
- Swedish export control framework
- Wassenaar Arrangement guidelines

**Classification:** MEDIUM RISK

**Rationale:** The AI-powered reconnaissance drones represent a dual-use technology with inherent risks, but multiple layers of control significantly mitigate weaponization concerns. The systems maintain meaningful human control, comply with IHL principles, and are subject to comprehensive export controls. The primary risks relate to potential technology adaptation rather than intended use. Strong end-use monitoring, contractual restrictions, and technical safeguards are essential to maintain appropriate control.
